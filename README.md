# Marketing_Spend_V_S_Sales_Analysis

## Project Name:
MARKETING SPEND V/S SALES ANALYSIS

## Objective
Analyze how TV, Radio and Newspaper ad spend affects Sales and build a Linear Regression model to predict Sales.

## Dataset
Kaggle Advertising Dataset
Features: TV, Radio, Newspaper
Target: Sales
All values are numerical.

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## EDA
Checked head() and info()
No null or duplicate values found
Correlation used to measure relationship strength

## Observations
TV has strongest relation with Sales
Radio has moderate relation with Sales
Newspaper has weakest relation with Sales

## Model
Linear Regression using TV, Radio, Newspaper as input features
Train-Test split applied

## Evaluation
R2 Score: 0.89
Adjusted R2: 0.89
MSE: 3.14
Actual vs Predicted plot shows good alignment

## Insights
TV is the most impactful marketing channel
Radio can be used as supporting channel
Newspaper has relatively low impact

## Limitations
Dataset size is limited

## Conclusion
Advertising spend can be used to predict Sales effectively using Linear Regression.

## Future Work
- Experiment with Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships.  
- Use Cross-Validation for more robust model evaluation.     
- Build a simple dashboard to visualize predictions and insights.
